Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, 8 March 1831 (see History of the Church, 1:166). Prior to this time Oliver Cowdery had acted as Church historian and recorder. John Whitmer had not sought an appointment as historian, but, being asked to serve in this capacity, he had said that he would obey the will of the Lord in the matter. He had already served as a secretary to the Prophet in recording many of the revelations received in the Fayette, New York, area. 1â€“4, John Whitmer is designated to keep the history of the Church and to write for the Prophet.
1. Behold, it is expedient in me that my servant John should write and keep a regular history, and assist you, my servant Joseph, in transcribing all things which shall be given you, until he is called to further duties.
2. Again, verily I say unto you that he can also lift up his voice in meetings, whenever it shall be expedient.
3. And again, I say unto you that it shall be appointed unto him to keep the church record and history continually; for Oliver Cowdery I have appointed to another office.
4. Wherefore, it shall be given him, inasmuch as he is faithful, by the Comforter, to write these things. Even so. Amen.
