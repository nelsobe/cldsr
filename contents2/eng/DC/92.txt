Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, 15 March 1833 (see History of the Church, 1:333). The revelation is directed to Frederick G. Williams, who had recently been appointed a counselor in the First Presidency. 1â€“2, The Lord gives a commandment relative to admission to the united order.
1. Verily, thus saith the Lord, I give unto the united order, organized agreeable to the commandment previously given, a revelation and commandment concerning my servant Frederick G. Williams, that ye shall receive him into the order. What I say unto one I say unto all.
2. And again, I say unto you my servant Frederick G. Williams, you shall be a lively member in this order; and inasmuch as you are faithful in keeping all former commandments you shall be blessed forever. Amen.
