Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Far West, Missouri, 8 July 1838, making known the disposition of the properties tithed as named in the preceding revelation, section 119 (see History of the Church, 3:44).
1. Verily, thus saith the Lord, the time is now come, that it shall be disposed of by a council, composed of the First Presidency of my Church, and of the bishop and his council, and by my high council; and by mine own voice unto them, saith the Lord. Even so. Amen.
