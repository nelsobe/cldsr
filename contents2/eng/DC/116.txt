Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, near Wightâ€™s Ferry, at a place called Spring Hill, Daviess County, Missouri, 19 May 1838 (see History of the Church, 3:35).
1. Spring Hill is named by the Lord Adam-ondi-Ahman, because, said he, it is the place where Adam shall come to visit his people, or the Ancient of Days shall sit, as spoken of by Daniel the prophet.
