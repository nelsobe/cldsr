Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon, at Fayette, New York, January 1831 (see History of the Church, 1:145). Preceding the record of this revelation, the Prophet wrote, “As James Covill rejected the word of the Lord, and returned to his former principles and people, the Lord gave unto me and Sidney Rigdon the following revelation” (History of the Church, 1:145). 1–3, Fear of persecution and cares of the world cause rejection of the gospel.
1. Behold, verily I say unto you, that the heart of my servant James Covill was right before me, for he covenanted with me that he would obey my word.
2. And he received the word with gladness, but straightway Satan tempted him; and the fear of persecution and the cares of the world caused him to reject the word.
3. Wherefore he broke my covenant, and it remaineth with me to do with him as seemeth me good. Amen.
